## Things you need:

### To just play:
Apply CCB_Round1.ups to a clean FE8 (U) rom using NUPS or Multipatch.

### To build:

Get a clean rom called "FE8_clean.gba" and put it in the extracted folder.

Run MAKE HACK_full when you make text or table changes, otherwise MAKE HACK_quick is enough.

## Tips:

- Press Select at the map to see danger zone
- Press Select at the stat screen to see growths
- Hold L to toggle animations on/off
- Hold A to speed up unit movement
- The movement arrow allows you to press A on allies and enemies 
- FLASHY MODE: any hit that kills a boss becomes a critical
- There is a certain secret code...

## Known Issues:

- Stone can sometimes crash the game when used on phantoms/Mark, resetting usually fixes this?
- Rarely, hp update in animations is wrong e.g. attacks showing no damage but enemy is hurt afterwards. If this happens while killing a boss, their death quote will not play and it may not trigger the Defeat Boss condition.
- Dancers can double if the enemy has Nihil - this will crash the game if animations are on. Hold L to turn them off if required.
- Resetting the game mid attack can sometimes give a unit the galeforce effect
- Devil effect is incompatible with counter/sol/etc, so it has been removed. Devil Axes will never backfire.
- Armsthrift can sometimes heal you? needs investigation
- Rarely, the game will freeze when you try to canto, reset and resume should fix it.
- Some bosses have weird weapon ranks/personal skills
- Units without a weapon equipped will display Str instead of Mag, even if they are a staff user/magic unit
- Astra in the arena will keep attacking thin air after the unit is dead
- Turn count in the credits skips several chapters
- Most houses don't work (but some do)
