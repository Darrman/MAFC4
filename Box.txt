Some of these ideas may not have been used, but I'll leave my old ramblings here.

Animation: Linus (Hero)
Animation: Generic (Necromancer)
Animation: Long Hair (Fighter)
Tileset: FE6 Western Isles village
Tileset: FE8 plains (ch10 Eirika)
Gameplay concept: Magical weapons
Gameplay concept: Shops
Gameplay concept: Units that must be protected

chapter is a door maze
open doors up by buying door keys from shop
opening doors will cause unrelated tiles to change, making things confusing
enemies are fairly weak and can be swatted aside easily for money
big boss has high defence and magic seal, take a magic sword to him in response
creeping low move siege tome guy spawns in as reinforcement giving a countdown

plot: reed bros are on the western isles trying to bail nino out or something
but nergal is doing an evil thing and they're in a big maze
so they have to beat up nergal
